# Differences between DIY Consumers and Conventional Consumers 

DIY (Do-It-Yourself) consumers and conventional consumers represent two distinct types of customers with different attitudes, behaviors, and preferences when it comes to purchasing and engaging with products and services.

DIY consumers are characterized by their desire for hands-on involvement in the creation, customization, or improvement of products. These individuals take pride in their ability to build, repair, or modify items on their own, often valuing the process as much as the end result. They are motivated by a variety of factors, such as the desire for personalization, cost savings, and the satisfaction of completing a task independently. For DIY consumers, the experience of engaging directly with the materials and tools is often a critical component of their consumer behavior. This group tends to be highly resourceful, often seeking out tutorials, online forums, and community advice to expand their knowledge and skills. They value products that provide flexibility, adaptability, and the opportunity to express their creativity, often preferring brands that support this ethos with comprehensive guides, high-quality raw materials, or modular components.

In contrast, conventional consumers typically prioritize convenience, reliability, and ease of use when selecting products and services. These consumers prefer ready-made, professionally crafted items that require minimal effort on their part. They are more likely to rely on the expertise of manufacturers and service providers, trusting that the product will meet their needs without the need for further modification or assembly. Conventional consumers often value established brands with a reputation for quality and customer service, as they provide a sense of security and assurance that the product will perform as expected. These consumers are also more likely to be influenced by traditional advertising and marketing strategies that highlight product features, warranties, and after-sales support.

The difference between DIY and conventional consumers also extends to their purchasing decisions and loyalty. DIY consumers are generally more deliberate in their purchasing process, often comparing multiple options and seeking the best value for their money in terms of durability and potential for customization. They are often loyal to brands that offer consistent quality and innovative solutions that align with their creative ambitions. On the other hand, conventional consumers may prioritize convenience and speed, often making quicker purchasing decisions based on immediate needs or brand familiarity. Their loyalty tends to be tied to consistent performance and a positive customer experience rather than the opportunity for creative engagement.

While both DIY and conventional consumers seek products and services that fulfill their needs, the approach they take and the values they prioritize differ significantly. DIY consumers embrace the challenge and creativity involved in doing things themselves, while conventional consumers lean towards convenience, reliability, and ease of use. Understanding these differences is crucial for businesses aiming to tailor their offerings to meet the unique needs of each consumer type. <sub> *source: chatgpt.com* </sub>

On my Github profile, I do this consumer differentiation using two ways to navigate my hardware electronics & software catalogs.  The icon below to the left is suited to all those users who are only looking for a solution to a problem and not into the real technical details. The icon to the right will take a user directly to a webpage with all hardware electronics currently at the [M.V.P. stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). If a user is not into technical information and is navigating only to buy ready to use, this is the option to choose.
