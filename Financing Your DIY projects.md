# Financing Your DIY Projects
*for the Unemployed*
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; To this date, in Belgium and Portugal, there isn't any official "pre-startup" category defined in regulations for entrepreneurship while unemployed. This means all job-searching activities must be made until a good entrepreneur project can be used to showcase personal skills and skillsets and DIY works show to have potential to be future MVP products and services in the near future. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2024, GitHub is the best place I know, that can be used to build an entrepreneurial project where anyone is able to follow and see changes happening over time, even participate in the project with ideas, questions and discussions about it.  However, it isn't enough, for the past 4 years I've been using Twitter and Linkedin to build a brand and an image supported with unedited content: unedited photos and videos, and  instant comments that begin full with errors and misspells that I correct overtime, during the day and week and anytime someone  comments back or sends a reaction, for instance, a Like.  To me, the most important to showcase is that I am real and that I am able to accept I can be wrong, and correct when necessary. This is a mandatory requirement for all wanting to use the internet in real-time with LIVE broadcast videos and instant comments.  I've been also using YouTube to show my day as a DIY entrepreneur in particular when a new solution is ready to be tested. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; As a DIY and entrepreneur, I need to show every day that I am working on something that will bring value and profit. Posting and publishing photos that are all but perfect is part of the daily job, and more importantly, posting better photos as the work happens over time until it is possible to make the perfect photo without any usage of Photoshop or A.I. tools.  Be prepared to receive quite a lot of bad reviews and critique, especially when the innovation and novelty of your project are ahead of mainstream trends.

## How to finance your DIY projects
This is a gray area. On one hand, you are receiving unemployment benefits, on the other hand, you are planning to sell online and profit from it. Both in Portugal and Belgium regulations and legality state payment of unemployment is reduced by the amount one profits over the month and year. This does not favor an entrepreneur, looking to self-finance his or her project to buy tools, equipment, and materials. without incurring legal obligations, such as loans and state taxes.    

**What to avoid at all costs** <br>
Renting a place, whether it is a shop, office or a home apartment is the biggest expense one has, and to make it worse, without any return for the project at the end of the month. The amount of money paid in rent adds up to 2\3 of the total amount of money one receives from unemployment. To put it in perspective, if your DIY project is going to need 3 months of disposable income when paying rent, you can expect 3x the time, or 9 months for this short example.  Renting will delay immensely one's project so much that it can force you to find a part-time job. It will make one, wanting to save elsewhere, such as food and clothing, transport, and even in utilities in particular heating. Saving is always possible, but there are better ways to do it, in between, learning how to save on fixed costs, is part of the entrepreneurial experience that brings immense value later, when it becomes a real business and activity.  Finally, when working on a DIY entrepreneurial project landlords tend to be very curious and sabotage it, in particular with additional expenses and unnecessary delays. 

When looking for a place to grow your DIY project keep all possibilities open, the ones with no fixed costs first. Options such as a tent on the side of the road and a motorhome, cannot and should not, be discarded. Just make sure you learn all the regulations and legality first, before buying a school bus or a DHL Van to convert it into a home or a place to work. These are *dirt cheap* to buy and with low cost of conversion into a motorhome, plus, they can always be improved later to fit any changes and needs.
