# Noteworthy Accomplishments
■ Pioneering digital transformation at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/Pages/default.aspx), [Laboratory of Construction and Building Materials](https://civil.uminho.pt/laboratorios/materiais/) from 2005 to 2009. <br>
<br>
■ Driving three digital transformations for start-up enterprises between 2007 and 2020. The most recent a "*[Digital Transformation on a Small Start-Up Enterprise: Design, Prototype, and Deployment Based on Human-Centered Design Principles for the Construction Sector](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/publications/human-centered-logistics-construction/)*".  <br>
<br>
■ Designed, tested, and prototyped over 70 technology solutions, accessible on GitHub. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  over [80 open hardware electronics](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/portfolio/hardware_electronics/) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  over [30 open source code software solutions](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-software-catalogue/blob/main/list_of_open_source_code_software.md) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  from which [16 smart hardware electronics fully matured](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/products/) into commercial products sold online <br>
<br>
■ Specialized in smart self-sensing carbon-based composites for Structural Health Monitoring from 2005-07, 2017 and 2020-23. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Designed & prototyped a [flexible electrode suitable for data acquisition with carbon fiber composites](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14759217231170001?journalCode=shma) <br>
<br>
■ Successfully designed & prototyped more than 7 open solutions for the automotive sector: <br>
