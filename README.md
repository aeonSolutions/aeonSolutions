### S.D.A.D - Smart Data Acquisition Device
An innovative method for experimental data acquisition and management of collected data in real-time compatible with any open environment. The proposed prototype for a smart DAQ device has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collected from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file, and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely. For instance a [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/MiguelTomasMainDataverse) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). Titled "[*Validation of Experimental Data Origins: A Swarm of DAQ devices able to Deliver Unique Experimental Data using Blockchain‚Äêlike Fingerprint ID to a Data Repository*](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScience-Smart-DAQ-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Data-to-a-Data-Repository/wiki/Validation-of-Experimental-Data-Origins:-A-Swarm-of-DAQ-devices-able-to-Deliver-Unique-Experimental-Data-using-Blockchain‚Äêlike-Fingerprint-ID-to-a-Data-Repository)".

### Open Hardware Electronics for Autonomous Vehicles
The overall objective of this open project is to extend the life of vehicles by updating them to current EU standards namely safety regulations and emission pollutants. As so vehicles undergo a process of refurbishment service and full-featured overhaul of technology updates from mechanical key components to the interior habitacle, comfort, and safety of a vehicle. Branded Auto RFTI‚Ñ¢ (refurbishment, facelift, and technology improvements) goes a step further than just a vehicle facelift and will differentiate by offering simple & easy hardware electronics and components for extending vehicle utilization life by means of technology upgrades to improve safety while at the same time reduce vehicle emissions. This project is reverse engineering a Volvo P2 to design and prototype of each individual module. <br>

### Artificial Intelligence & Inteligent Machines
 "*Intelligent Machines (IM) are capable of understanding "moral values", however, they come with minimum hardware requirements and specifications. For instance, the total number of sensors installed must be comparable to the number and sensitivity of "biological sensors" in the human body. This hardware requirement is followed by the next, a software minimum requirement one capable of collecting all sensor data, analyzing it, and operating factually, in "real-time", and in accordance with the surrounding environment while at the same time acting safely among all near .....
(...) <br>
The same cannot be said about Artificial intelligence (AI). (...) at best, it will be capable of mimicking "moral values" from past events and past data. (...) Which makes it dangerous and unsafe when asked to make decisions about the present time. Even in cases when the model has 100 0% accuracy ( the infamous R<sup>2</sup> many scientists like to showcase in their published works).*" <sub> 24-08-2024 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7232645060876521474?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7232645060876521474%2C7233097561480269824%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287233097561480269824%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7232645060876521474%29">read the conversation  on Linkedin</a>  </sub> <br>

**For Students** <br>
If you're a student starting a college or a university degree I strongly recommend, and advise, to learn all about data repositories, such as GitHub, and also all about "a timeline history of records". For instance use Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube and start publishing, since day one at school, about everything. Every insignificant task and work has value, so make sure others know it too! Be AGILE publish photos and videos, show errors and mistakes, and how you solved them later, with more photos, videos, and comments. This way, when you finally get your degree and diploma, you will have an authentic, trustworthy, professional curriculum that can be used to advertise your skills. When looking for a job. When starting up your own entrepreneurial business and enterprise. The next link is a [quick example of what I'm on about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB3nzbTPTA).
