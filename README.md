### S.D.A.D - Smart Data Acquisiton Device
An innovative method for experimental data acquisition and management of collected data in real-time and is compatible with any open environment. The proposed smart DAQ device prototype has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collected from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file, and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse. To learn more about this project click on the video below. Visit my [open science projects](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Open-Scientific-Research) to find out more about my current scientific projects.
