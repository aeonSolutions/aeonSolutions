‚ÑπÔ∏è Read the Science behind this project, [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-science-rammed_earth_project/wiki)

Rammed earth construction is a method where natural materials, primarily soil, are compressed to form solid walls. Builders typically mix earth with stabilizers like clay or cement to enhance strength, though traditional techniques might just use raw soil. This mixture is then poured into wooden or metal forms, where it's compacted layer by layer using manual or mechanical rammers. As the layers are compressed, they bond to create thick, durable walls.

These walls are known for their thermal mass, which helps regulate indoor temperatures by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. Rammed earth buildings often have a distinctive look, with visible layers or strata that show the construction process. The material itself can vary in color, texture, and composition, depending on the local soil. Over time, the walls harden further, adding to their longevity.

This technique is ancient, and used in many cultures worldwide, from China‚Äôs Great Wall to more modern eco-friendly designs, where it‚Äôs valued for being sustainable, low-cost, and using natural, locally sourced materials. <sub> *Source: chatGPT.com* </sub>

**For Students** <br>
If you're a student starting a college or a university degree I strongly recommend, and advise, to learn all about data repositories, such as GitHub, and also all about "a timeline history of records". For instance use Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube and start publishing, since day one at school, about everything. Every insignificant task and work has value, so make sure others know it too! Be AGILE publish photos and videos, show errors and mistakes, and how you solved them later, with more photos, videos, and comments. This way, when you finally get your degree and diploma, you will have an authentic, trustworthy, professional curriculum that can be used to advertise your skills. When looking for a job. When starting up your own entrepreneurial business and enterprise. The next link is a [quick example of what I'm on about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB3nzbTPTA).

**A final statement about Mental Health in Science** <br>
It is found recurrently on the internet news and comments about another scientific researcher, in particular junior and medior researchers, going through some kind of mental health difficulties in particular those associated with sensory overload events. Promoted by abusive usage of wireless devices, assembled or modified to actuate at a distance and invisible, causing harm to a victim‚Äôs neurobiology. This is an old area of knowledge, that now needs to be openly discussed and commented, in a peaceful constructive way towards identification of solutions to all abusive usages of wireless frequency waves (radiation or vibration) in electronic devices. Open solutions are the correct path toward safety in usage of all things related to such technologies. Be knowledgeable to stay safe.
