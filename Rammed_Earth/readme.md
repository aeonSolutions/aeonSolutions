‚ÑπÔ∏è Read the Science behind this project, [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-science-rammed_earth_project/wiki)

Rammed earth construction is a method where natural materials, primarily soil, are compressed to form solid walls. Builders typically mix earth with stabilizers like clay or cement to enhance strength, though traditional techniques might just use raw soil. This mixture is then poured into wooden or metal forms, where it's compacted layer by layer using manual or mechanical rammers. As the layers are compressed, they bond to create thick, durable walls.

These walls are known for their thermal mass, which helps regulate indoor temperatures by absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. Rammed earth buildings often have a distinctive look, with visible layers or strata that show the construction process. The material itself can vary in color, texture, and composition, depending on the local soil. Over time, the walls harden further, adding to their longevity.

This technique is ancient, and used in many cultures worldwide, from China‚Äôs Great Wall to more modern eco-friendly designs, where it‚Äôs valued for being sustainable, low-cost, and using natural, locally sourced materials. <sub> *Source: chatGPT.com* </sub>

## The Problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nowadays with the high costs of both renting and buying a home, it has forced individuals and families to sign bank loan mortgage contracts with a lifetime payment duration. Currently, in Portugal, it means 40 years of monthly down payments that when all paid and done it is almost time to retire. The same can be found in many other countries not only in Europe but also in America, the United States, and Canada.  This is a problem that adult individuals and couples have to face nowadays and also teenagers going to a university to get a degree. 

## Solution
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Amidst COVID-19, in 2020, many Americans decided to promote their solution to this problem on YouTube. In the United States and Canada buying a Van and a School Bus is so cheap it became the vehicle of choice for Do It Yourself (DIY) type of conversion and transformation into a motorhome on Wheels. Entry conversion costs start at only $20,000 USD and can go as high as $80,000 USD and it can take between 3 months to 12 months to do a conversation.  In the end, anyone is able to sell it for a fair price. For instance on the next Facebook group "[Schoolies for sale](https://www.facebook.com/groups/238599331115958)". <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This new lifestyle to avoid wasting money on renting and avoiding paying bank loans consists of living and working in a motorhome for at least the minimum period of time that enables them to buy property land without the need to finance and go into debt. The Youtuber known as [Christian Schaffer](https://www.youtube.com/@ChristianSchaffer) has an extensive playlist on how to live in a motorhome including costs, lifestyle, and dangers of living and working in a home on wheels. In real-life terms, in the USA, it means 3 to 5 years of living in a home on wheels. However it does not end here, for one to be able to have their own property and home without entering into any long-term debt, after buying a property, one needs to learn how to construct, fabricate, and build themselves, a home to live in. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  On YouTube and Google, it is possible to find many cheap construction solutions, however, there is a better, in particular, the Australian construction technique known as "rammed earth" that I give preference and add my own personal techniques and materials to build one. This construction technique utilizes the soil and wood the property is able to provide and that can be used as construction building materials for zero cost. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  To build their homes, the owners rent tools and equipment plus Engineering services to mentor them during all phases of construction. The [Red Earth Ranch channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RedEarthRanch) on YouTube has a detailed and extensive video blog showing all phases of construction of their rammed earth home. In the end, one can own a home, that is equal to those [beautiful homes that are possible to browse and see on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/7388786866440713/), while paying for it in only 5 years.

**For Students** <br>
If you're a student starting a college or a university degree I strongly recommend, and advise, to learn all about data repositories, such as GitHub, and also all about "a timeline history of records". For instance use Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube and start publishing, since day one at school, about everything. Every insignificant task and work has value, so make sure others know it too! Be AGILE publish photos and videos, show errors and mistakes, and how you solved them later, with more photos, videos, and comments. This way, when you finally get your degree and diploma, you will have an authentic, trustworthy, professional curriculum that can be used to advertise your skills. When looking for a job. When starting up your own entrepreneurial business and enterprise. The next link is a [quick example of what I'm on about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB3nzbTPTA).

<br>

**A final statement about Mental Health in Science** <br>
It is found recurrently on the internet news and comments about another scientific researcher, in particular junior and medior researchers, going through some kind of mental health difficulties in particular those associated with sensory overload events. Promoted by abusive usage of wireless devices, assembled or modified to actuate at a distance and invisible, causing harm to a victim‚Äôs neurobiology. This is an old area of knowledge, that now needs to be openly discussed and commented, in a peaceful constructive way towards identification of solutions to all abusive usages of wireless frequency waves (radiation or vibration) in electronic devices. Open solutions are the correct path toward safety in usage of all things related to such technologies. Be knowledgeable to stay safe.
