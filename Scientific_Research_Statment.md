# Miguel Tomás | Research Statement
*draft document*

My research interest is in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with a focus on custom electronics for smart devices and smart technologies. Smart electronics technologies are critical in many applications as a way to promote and facilitate equal and diverse opportunities regardless of economic or social status. To achieve such reality at the core needs to be open source and open data methodologies and solutions as the base for further development and broader compatibility across ecosystems. For instance, in everyday objects, one rarely notices that they are there, aware of environmental and structural conditions collecting data for identification of potential hazards and even reduced quality of life conditions. My research on A.I. smart technologies focuses on, and it is always present, open source and open data, and this way I know am contributing to knowledge base solutions in society available to anyone, regardless of race, or culture at a fair cost. This effort has led to 10 international-level publications and 15 M.V.P. limited open-licensed prototypes. There are three key approaches I have pursued:
1.	Focus on real-time, live environments, for concept solutions and prototypes using as base ground open data and open source for conceptualization, design, and prototyping;
2.	Focus on simple and intuitive solutions to a point where the user of the technology naturally perceives “as nothing has changed” by users of the technology;
3.	Develop individual and user-centric solutions with awareness of compatible networks available in surroundings able to connect and communicate with both Edge Networks and one-2-one devices.

***Focus on real-time, live environments, for conceptualization and prototyping of solutions using open technologies*** <br>
As computers continue to become less expensive and smaller with advancements in technology, they offer smart abilities to many passive objects, providing enhanced functionalities such as sensing and interaction. Ideally, computer integration should not be affected by the limitations of a brand, and instead, hardware and software should be made in such a way  that allows sharing of data with any other system and environment without any additional software or hardware. This is possible when technology solutions adopt open mindsets (data, code, hardware) from the conceptual stage, during development, conceptualization, and prototyping of a solution. In my research, I have been deploying such open mindsets, methodologies, and guidelines for more than twenty years, and this has allowed me to understand the purpose of a smart device (or technology) without the well-known limitations of traditional licensing and patenting background. Open licensing of a prototype has many advantages over traditional closed development, for instance, of lower time required to reach the M.V.P. stage and even broader future users for a particular technology solution deployed, while at the same time leaving room for closed licensing.

***Focus on truly simple and intuitive solutions to known problems and challenges*** <br>
With generalization and access to the internet everywhere and to anyone, advertising a service or a product becomes more time-consuming. Including higher education. Consumers nowadays are well informed about what they want with constant live data access to read and consult about particular and specific details of what they seek. This means that a prototype researcher must be able to provide technological solutions with more detail to the point of being perceived as a natural choice. The simplest solutions are the best, however, require an additional step when prototyping, the one of user testing in real life, while providing valuable feedback about usage and what feels to be missing. In open environments, this can be made to happen simultaneously and as an integral part of the prototyping life cycle. Platforms such as GitHub are a good way to set up open collaboration while sharing technological solutions with anyone on the internet looking for that one in particular. Moreover, it can be set up in such a way that any person wants to share their views while using a specific revision of a prototype. 
  
Develop individual and user-centric solutions with awareness of surroundings capable of connecting and communicating with both edge networks and one-to-one devices.
Mobile devices are discrete and sparse, but our physical world is large and continuous, which leaves gaps where computers are incapable of enhancing users (e.g., logging activities and environmental facets for healthier and more productive life and work decisions; assistive and autonomous technologies). Additionally, most interactive systems today demand a user’s attention and explicit input due to the lack of contextual information, eliminating immediate response to user needs. My research aims to fill in these spatial and informational gaps through the deployment of sensors in open environments. 


***Future Research*** <br>
After almost 30 years of experience in computer science domains, is now time for me to validate at the academic level my S.T.E.M. skills. I’m the author of 4 published scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals. Co-author in 2 more published papers. I have a 120 ECTS Master's degree in Smart Carbon Fiber Composites for Structural Health Monitoring [3] [4] [6]. I have completed successfully a postgraduate course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Modelling at the University of Alcala (Spain) in 2020 [6]. Recently I have enrolled in the course “AI in Society” as part of a Master in Artificial Intelligence at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. I’ve been mentoring technology solutions and ways of doing science using the latest trends for remote collaboration and cooperation in asynchronous environments to colleagues at two universities in Brazil and one in Portugal. In the next years, I intend to do two more Master's degrees: one in Robotics and another in Economics.  Some areas of future research that I plan to initiate in the upcoming years:
•	Explore and advance novel sensing, fabrication, and machine learning techniques: I believe that smart sensing will continue to expand and grow as we deepen our understanding of technologies and their use domains.
•	Advance novel techniques and solutions to deliver data without the need for encryption using open environment logic.

 Since fabrication decides the characteristics of materials with the ability to conduct data signals, it plays a profound role in sensing. I am eager to look for opportunities to integrate novel sensing into fabrication techniques – from fast prototyping methods to the simplest production processes. Additionally, I plan to investigate artificial intelligence technologies tailored to novel activity sensing. Finally, I will continue to open-source my lab’s projects to facilitate collaborations and real-world impact, while at the same time developing new and improved ways of doing scientific research that find support and utilize the latest open-source and open hardware technologies. For example, extending realms of the laboratory into open fields with remote data acquisition and data authenticity validation. With that purpose in mind, I have been designing and making available on GitHub many PCB electronics, to achieve truly ubiquitous sensing and usage in the everyday life to anyone and at a fair and affordable cost.
Fulfilling this future will significantly lower the cost of ubiquitous smart devices in everyday life while making them much easier to maintain. It is not clear what principles we should leverage and what sensing granularity we can achieve. I want to answer these types of research questions with my future work where I will develop smart sense solutions. For city-scale applications, such as smart asphalt roads, or net-zero smart lighting. For environmental monitoring. For structural health monitoring. I believe that my future work in this area will radically change the way people implement IoT and smart environments, and make their applications simpler and more natural to be widely adopted across society.

I am also eager to expand my research to new application domains, extending from homes to hospitals, farms, factories, and beyond, where smart sense technologies are crucial in applications such as sleep monitoring, digital agriculture, and equipment maintenance. I am equally excited about research fields including digital healthcare, accessibility, K-12 education, 3D robotics for construction automation, and end-user programming, where I believe my expertise in materials with sensing properties will fuel new collaborations. Additionally, I am interested in using my research to promote open environments. Open Data. Open Source. Open Hardware; as foundation to applied science.
