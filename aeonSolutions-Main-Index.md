## About Miguel Tomas
Hi there, <br>
my name is Miguel Tomas. I was born in Porto City, Portugal. Started programming computer code on a Commodore 64 with only 11 years old. 

I invite you, to fully browse all my repositories here on Github, and visit the web address links, where you can find, for instance, source code for software, designs for hardware electronics, read about my scientific publications and articles about technology, and even view videos on my YouTube channel about Artificial Intelligence and software & hardware electronics solutions deployed at enterprises. You will also find valued time reading my daily tweets on Twitter about simple technology idea fragments I encountered during the workday.

### Open Innovation
&nbsp;&nbsp; Miguel has an extensive portfolio encompassing more than [70 open hardware smart PCB electronics](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/portfolio/hardware_electronics/) and over [30 open software solutions](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/aeonlabs-open-software-catalogue), from which [16 smart hardware electronics fully matured](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/products/) into commercial products sold online. To learn more about open innovation using Github you are invited to read the article "[Open Innovation from D.I.Y to M.V.P. using GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-innovation-from-diy-mvp-using-github-miguel-silva-asoaf/?trackingId=2J7XZsGWQkqOWCAluFR8dg%3D%3D)".

&nbsp;&nbsp; Miguel possesses a deep commitment to advancing knowledge for everyone. He is the author of [5 scientific publications and co-authors 2](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-5179), He holds a Master's degree in Smart Carbon Fiber Composites for Structural Health Monitoring, a second master's degree, and 82.5 ECTS in Master-level courses on Artificial Intelligence and Smart IoT Technologies from Swedish and Spanish universities. The most recent publication, "A deep neural network for electrical resistance calibration of self-sensing carbon fiber polymer composites compatible with Edge computing Structural monitoring hardware electronics," is available in the Journal Structural Health Monitoring ([doi:10.1177/14759217231170001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14759217231170001?journalCode=shma)). 

 In 2021 he moved, permanently, all his scientific research data to publicly accessible repositories stored as [dataverses hosted on the servers at Harvard University](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/MiguelTomasMainDataverse).

**For Students** <br>
If you're a student starting a college or a university degree I strongly recommend, and advise, to learn all about data repositories, such as GitHub, and also all about "a timeline history of records". For instance use Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube and start publishing, since day one at school, about everything. Every insignificant task and work has value, so make sure others know it too! Be AGILE publish photos and videos, show errors and mistakes, and how you solved them later, with more photos, videos, and comments. This way, when you finally get your degree and diploma, you will have an authentic, trustworthy, professional curriculum that can be used to advertise your skills. When looking for a job. When starting up your own entrepreneurial business and enterprise.
