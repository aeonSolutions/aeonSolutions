## About Miguel Tomas
Hi there, <br>
my name is Miguel Tomas. I was born in Porto City, Portugal. I started programming computer code on a Commodore 64 with only 11 years old. 

I invite you, to fully browse all my repositories here on Github, and visit the web address links, where you can find, for instance, source code for software, designs for hardware electronics, read about my scientific publications and articles about technology, and even view videos on my YouTube channel about Artificial Intelligence and software & hardware electronics solutions deployed at enterprises. You will also find valued time reading my [daily tweets on Twitter](https://x.com/AeonlabsS) about simple technology idea fragments I encountered during the workday. Visit the [publications page](https://aeonsolutions.github.io/publications/) to find out more about published scientific communications in peer-reviewed journals.  On my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/migueltomas/), you can find PDF copies of university diplomas, course certifications, recommendation letters, and much more.

### <img height="18px" src="https://us-central1-trackgit-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/token/ping/lg7xdm3wvd3237y06ujl" /> Open Scientific Research
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a deep commitment to advancing knowledge for everyone. I'm the author of [5 scientific publications and co-authors 2](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-5179), I hold a Master's degree in Smart Carbon Fiber Composites for Structural Health Monitoring, a second master's degree, and 82.5 ECTS in Master-level courses on Artificial Intelligence and Smart IoT Technologies from Swedish and Spanish universities. The most recent publication, "A deep neural network for electrical resistance calibration of self-sensing carbon fiber polymer composites compatible with Edge computing Structural monitoring hardware electronics," is available in the Journal Structural Health Monitoring ([doi:10.1177/14759217231170001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14759217231170001?journalCode=shma)).

 In 2021 I moved, permanently, all my scientific research data to publicly accessible repositories stored as [dataverses hosted on the servers at Harvard University](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/MiguelTomasMainDataverse) and here, on GitHub.

**For Students** <br>
If you're a student starting a college or a university degree I strongly recommend, and advise, to learn all about data repositories, such as GitHub, and also all about "a timeline history of records". For instance use Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube and start publishing, since day one at school, about everything. Every insignificant task and work has value, so make sure others know it too! Be AGILE publish photos and videos, show errors and mistakes, and how you solved them later, with more photos, videos, and comments. This way, when you finally get your degree and diploma, you will have an authentic, trustworthy, professional curriculum that can be used to advertise your skills. When looking for a job. When starting up your own entrepreneurial business and enterprise. The next link is a [quick example of what I'm on about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB3nzbTPTA).

<br>

**A final statement about Mental Health in Science** <br>
It is found recurrently on the internet news and comments about another scientific researcher, in particular junior and medior researchers, going through some kind of mental health difficulties in particular those associated with sensory overload events. Promoted by abusive usage of wireless devices, assembled or modified to actuate at a distance and invisible, causing harm to a victim‚Äôs neurobiology. This is an old area of knowledge, that now needs to be openly discussed and commented, in a peaceful constructive way towards identification of solutions to all abusive usages of wireless frequency waves (radiation or vibration) in electronic devices. Open solutions are the correct path toward safety in usage of all things related to such technologies. Be knowledgeable to stay safe.
