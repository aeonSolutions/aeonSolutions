I invite you, to browse this document, and visit the web address links, where you can, for instance, download certifications and read about scientific publications, and technology articles, or even view presentation videos on my YouTube channel, some about software solutions deployed at enterprises. You will also find valued time reading my daily tweets about simple technology idea fragments I encounter during my workday.
