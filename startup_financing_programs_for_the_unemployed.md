**General Tips for Accessing Startup Programs for the Unemployed in Europe:** <br>
- **Check Local Employment Services**: Many programs are administered through local employment offices or public employment services (PES), so contacting them can provide direct access to available support.
- **Research EU Funding Opportunities**: The EU provides funding through various schemes that can be accessed by unemployed individuals looking to start a business.
- **Look for Regional and National Initiatives**: Countries often have region-specific programs tailored to local economic needs, so it's important to explore these options.
- **Utilize Business Support Networks**: Many countries have business incubators, accelerators, and networks that offer support to new entrepreneurs, especially those who are unemployed.

These programs can vary greatly by country and region, so it is advisable to seek information specific to the country of interest.

## Portugal
In Portugal, there are [EPAT entities](https://www.iefp.pt/estruturas-de-servicos-apoio) dedicated to providing mentoring and support to writing the necessary *Investment Plan* for an entrepreneur to be able to apply to any Estate Funding Program and even any Estate supported financing program in a bank.  After you have your DIY project built here on GitHub or any other data repository where anyone can read and understand what is about your entrepreneurial project, and when the time comes to advance into researching your market and future clients for your M.V.P. solutions, just before starting any business activities at *Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (AT)* (the Portuguese IRS), the entrepreneur needs to contact a local EPAT entity to make the necessary arrangements for additional support and mentoring for his\her project, in return you will receive a signed document where it states you are working with them towards writing of an *Investment Plan* with the final purpose of starting an enterprise and business.   

### microInvest Program
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the maximum financing amount is 95% of 20,000eur, the bank where one can apply for this program has also its own "*access conditions*", and this means the maximum financing lowers to 75%. To get to 95%, the entrepreneur must also meet the additional criteria defined by the bank. This information is usually omitted and must be asked to learn how it can be possible to reach 95%.  This is one of the reasons many projects are rejected for financing simply because the "investment plan" is designed for 95% of 20,000 euros.  In practical terms, the microInvest program allows financing up to 15,000 euros, instead of the 20,000 euros advertised on the internet. To get the 95% of the 20,000 euros advertised, additional documentation is required by the bank.

### Invest + Program
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the maximum financing amount is 95% of 100,000eur, the bank where one can apply for this program has also its own "*access conditions*", and this means the maximum financing lowers to 75%. To get to 95%, the entrepreneur must also meet the additional criteria defined by the bank. This information is usually omitted and must be asked to learn how it can be possible to reach 95%.  This is one of the reasons many projects are rejected for financing simply because the "investment plan" is designed for 95% of 100,000 euros.

#### Required Documentation
When submitting an application for any of the startup programs above, I.E.F.P. asks to be appended additional documentation.
